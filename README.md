I have thouroughly enjoyed building this dictionary app from scratch and was able to explore the artistic side of me more in terms of experimenting with the webpage layout. What I found challening was understanding the concepts behind properties, events, conditional rendering and states. It was difficult to keep track of which function to incorporat into the correct component.
