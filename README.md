I have thouroughly enjoyed building this dictionary app from scratch and was able to explore the artistic side of me more in terms of experimenting with the webpage layout. What I found challening was understanding the concepts behind properties, events, conditional rendering and states. It was difficult to keep track of which function to incorporat into the correct component.

Netlify was chosen as the hosting website not just because it is free, but it selects the best CDN and distributes content, creating pre-built websites that load faster than on traditional hosting networks. Instead of loading the site each time the visitor goes to a page, the visitor gets a pre-loaded version straight from the nearest geographical server, sharply reducing load times.
As a result, the HTML, CSS, and JS are then deployed and distributed across a large number of content delivery networks. When a visitor tries to access my  site, it automatically chooses the data center closest to the user and serves him/her the static files.  It is easy to run the website as it connects to a git repo and every time a programmer pushes a commit, it will automatically build the site, run plugins and deploy!
